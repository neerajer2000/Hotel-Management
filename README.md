## About The Project
![Screenshot](./assets/screen.png)
This website is a final project we made for our Software Engineering class at Nazarbayev University. 

The project implements a Hotel Management System where guests can book hotel rooms, desk clerks can approve reservations and managers can control hotel employees (for example, working hours of desk clerks).

Our app supports different roles and displays content accordingly. There are currently three roles available: Guest, Manager and Desk Clerk.

In order to get access to the admin panel, you have to log in as a manager or desk clerk via this [VPN access link](https://hms.ironsoul.me/vpn-access). For the sake of simplicity, this URL is publicly available but in the real project, it should be accessible only through VPN.
